\chapter{Software}

This project required the creation of an algorithm powerful enough to accurately detect and classify subtle foot movements whilst small enough to fit into a small memory space and run in a sub threshold platform. This chapter analysises the tools and techniques used to develop such an algorithm, and discusses some of the trade-offs and optimisations that were investigated.
