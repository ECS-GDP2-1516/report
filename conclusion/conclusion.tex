\chapter{Conclusion}

The algorithm that the team developed is successful at providing a proof of concept that there is scope to run complex code on a system matching the specification of ARM's new sub-threshold Cortex M0+ processor. With such low power memory usage, this project has proved that devices with extremely high constraints may still be relied upon for important functions.

The team is satisfied that they acted effectively as a group, particularly in respect to separating tasks in a sensible manner. The communication between members was very strong, in part because the morale between the individuals.
