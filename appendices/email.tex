Hi Toby,

This is great, well done! I'm very happy with the progress and am looking forward to reading the full report. This was a challenging set of constraints but you seem to have made a working system that meets the spec. This will be a good new workload to add to the suite of tests we run on our experimental sub-threshold testchips. When the report is complete I'd like to get hold of your code and some canned data samples, so that I can replay it on our sub-threshold hardware.

I'd like to be there for the final presentation, but it will depend on the dates â€“ please let me know when it's finalised.
