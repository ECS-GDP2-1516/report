\chapter{Risk Assessment}

The project's risk assessment is shown on the following two pages, ordered from highest priority to lowest. The
first two risks did materialise for this team, however the
planned mitigation was appropriate so there were no significant issues caused by these.

\begin{landscape}
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ | m{3cm} | m{6.5cm} | m{2cm} | m{1.5cm} | m{1.5cm} | m{7cm} | } 
  \hline
  Risk & Description & Likelihood & Impact & Priority & Mitigation \\
  \hline

  Developer Health &
  Ongoing health issues with one team member may disrupt their ability to work &
  0.8 & 0.6 & 0.48 &
  Ensure that two team members are working on each core task; in that way developer illness will not delay progress of the project. \\
  \hline

  Ethical Approval Delays &
  Issues receiving ethical approval may delay the date at which initial collection can be done, which would in turn delay the development schedule. &
  0.6 & 0.6 & 0.36 &
  Plan to complete the ethical approval request early in the project. Ensure the development schedule does not rely on the movement data from the very beginning. \\
  \hline
 
  Unable to scale algorithm &
  The system we have been given does not allow division or floating point. It may not be possible to reduce an algorithm to these constraints without prohibitively low running time &
  0.5 & 0.7 & 0.35 &
  Use this constraint when deciding an optimum algorithm: where possible, choose methods which require less computation and, specifically, fewer operations relying on complex mathematical operations which require accurate floating point or division. \\
  \hline

  Code does not fit on device &
  When compiling the code, its size may exceed the maximum of 8KB meaning it will not fit onto the device. This may happen because too many libraries are required or the algorithm itself is too large &
  0.4 & 0.8 & 0.32 &
  Use this constraint when deciding an optimum algorithm: where possible, choose lower sampling frequencies as these require less weights \\
  \hline

  Not able to recognise exercises &
  The possibility that no algorithm can be discovered or created to distinguish exercise from non-exercise &
  0.3 & 0.9 & 0.27 &
  Use Weka, a well known and well tested, tool designed to bulk test multiple existing machine learning algorithms \\

  \hline
  Risk & Description & Likelihood & Impact & Priority & Mitigation \\
  \hline

  Loss of work &
  Technical, physical or human issues may lead to loss of work or data, which will delay progress
  & 0.3 & 0.9 & 0.27 &
  All code kept under Git version control, where this is not under licence it will be backed up to GitHub. Repositories which include non-publishable code will be backed up to a personal git server of one of the team members. All documents written using LaTeX, which will also be kept under version control, or Google Documents. \\
  \hline

  Unable to perform second participant study  &
  There may not be enough time to test the prototype on a large selection of participants to measure its effectiveness  &
  0.8 & 0.2 & 0.16 &
  We can perform the tests on ourselves which should give sufficient indication on how well the prototype performs. \\
  \hline
  
  FPGA &
  The FPGA is a complex device - if we are unable to obtain or understand the relevant documentation, it will be difficult to complete the required verilog &
  0.3 & 0.5 & 0.15 &
  Ask ARM for the required documentation and maintain contact in case of issues. \\
  \hline

  mBed clock speed &
  The mBed's specification states that it may have an error on its clock speed, making measurements difficult &
  0.1 & 0.1 & 0.01 &
  Test clock speeds under various conditions to see the impact. Also develop on the FPGA which does not have this issue. \\
  \hline

  Code cannot be compiled &
  Issues with library compatibilities or compiler limitations may cause problems when compiling our code for the device &
  0.1 & 0.8 & 0.08 &
  Use ARM's provided compiler, which is well supported and relies on common libraries. \\
