* We are required to include authorship of sections, so use \namedsection{Section Name}{Your name} to do this.
* Break chapters off into seperate directories, with each section (or lower-level heading) into a seperate file for a less complex main document.
* Current word count target is 20,000-25,000
* Add relevent figures everywhere
