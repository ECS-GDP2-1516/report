\note{What experiments were conducted in order to determine machine learning feasibility?}

\note{Why did we use 3 classes rather than just 2?}

\note{What classification algorithms were trialled? What kind of results were achieved with these. Explain and discuss the workings of each algorithm / type of algorithm.}

\note{What issues were faced as a result of implementing a machine learning algorithm on a constrained system? How were these problems overcome?}

\note{What tools were used in order to assist with the machine learning?}

\note{As a result of the user study, how did the results change? Note observed results due to the user study.}
