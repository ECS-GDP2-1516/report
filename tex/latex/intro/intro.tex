\section{Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The algorithm must be capable of detecting and monitoring exercises designed to combat deep vein thrombosis
  \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item These are exercises which can be performed in a plane, particularly in long haul flights and include:
    \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
      \item Foot rotations
      \item Pointing feet up and down
      \item Shoulder rolling
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Other activities such as walking should be distinguished as not being exercise
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The algorithm must be suitable to execute on an ultra-low-power subthreshold ARM Cortex-M0+
  \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item This device has a limited processor clocked from 100 kHz to a maximum of 3 MHz
    \item There is also only 8 kB of available memory
    \item Therefore, the algorithm should be highly optimised to use as little memory and require as little processing power as possible
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The Cortex-M0+ must be emulated in a test platform as working with an actual M0+ is not feasible
  \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item The test platform should be capable of being clocked at frequencies ranging from a 100s of kHz to a few MHz
    \item The test platform should have at least 32 kB of memory to aid with testing and to act as a fall back if 8 kB cannot be achieved
    \item There must be an accelerometer sensor on the platform that readings can be taken from
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Research into various potential algorithms must take place
  \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item Machine learning approaches should be focussed on
    \item Algorithms which are used on unconstrained systems should be considered first
    \item The feasibility of constraining those algorithms should then be investigated
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Participant studies should be performed to gather movement data to train the algorithm
  \begin{enumerate}[label*=\arabic*.]
    \item Ethics approval will need to be obtained
  \end{enumerate}
  \item The developed algorithm must be deployed to the test platform
  \item The final system must then be evaluated in terms of its accuracy at detecting exercises
\end{enumerate}
