\section{Division of Responsibilities}

At the group's first meeting, the project brief was agreed and then split to smaller tasks which could be more easily planned. These were: designing the algorithm, implementing the algorithm on the embedded platform, designing and building the hardware components of the system, and performing the user study and associated ethical approval request.

Assigning these tasks to individual members proved a simple task, as each member's interests mapped cleanly to each area. Mohit Gupta and Calin Pasat, as the group's two individuals coming from an Electronic Engineering programme, were to take charge of the hardware aspects of the project. Daniel Playle has the most experience with Machine Learning and as such he would lead the background research and algorithm training part of the task. The majority of the development was to be completed by Emily Shepherd, who is the strongest in the group at C programming, particularly when focusing at optimisations. Toby Finch, as the remaining first class Computer Scientist, was to join Emily in development and take the lead with the user study and ethical approval process.
