\chapter{Results}

We have seen the methods that were used to research and train a neural network capable of recognising exercise, and then the work to implement this into a program capable of running on a Cortex-M0, which was developed to act as a emulation platform for the proposed sub threshold device. This chapter evaluates the outcomes of this work, highlighting the successes that have been made, and analysing where further development may be required.
