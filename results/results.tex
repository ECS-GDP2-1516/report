\chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}

We have seen the methods that were used to research and train a neural network capable of recognising exercise, and then the work to implement this into a program capable of running on a Cortex-M0, which was developed to act as an emulation platform for the proposed sub-threshold device. This chapter evaluates the outcomes of this work, highlighting the successes that have been made, and analysing where further development may be required.
